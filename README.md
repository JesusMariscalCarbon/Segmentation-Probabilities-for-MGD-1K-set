# Segmentation-Probabilities-for-MGD-1K-set
ðŸ“‚ 01_NetworkSegmentationResults:
This folder contains the segmentation outputs generated by the neural networks developed in the study. For each image in the MGD-1K dataset, the network produces a probability map in which each pixel is assigned a likelihood of belonging to a specific anatomical region (eyelid or gland). These outputs are stored in two widely used formats, ensuring compatibility across different research environments:
â€¢	01a_EyelidNpy â†’ Eyelid segmentation probability maps stored as NumPy arrays (.npy), suitable for Python-based analysis.
â€¢	01b_EyelidMat â†’ Eyelid segmentation probability maps stored in MATLAB format (.mat).
â€¢	02a_GlandNpy â†’ Gland segmentation probability maps stored as NumPy arrays (.npy).
â€¢	02b_GlandMat â†’ Gland segmentation probability maps stored in MATLAB format (.mat).
These files can be employed directly for further analyses, visualisations, or as inputs for subsequent processing pipelines.
